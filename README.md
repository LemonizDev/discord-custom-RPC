# discord-custom-RPC
A Custom Rich Presence status for discord


Must have discord.js v12 installed. Command to install: npm i discord.js@v12

Must have discord-rpc installed. Command: npm i discord-rpc


First things first, you must go to discord.com/developers/applications and create an application WITH THE NAME OF WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE FROM OUTSIDE. What I mean is, if I name my application Lemon, Whenever someone looks at my profile they're gonna see "playing Lemon" hope its clear. 

After this you must click on RPC and then art assets, here you can pick an image for your RPC, once you upload the image you will be able to see the name of the image below the art assets, copy and save that name as you're gonna be needing it later. Further instructions will be found in the index.js file.

Thank you
